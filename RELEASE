Release notes for GStreamer OpenMAX IL wrapper plugin 1.2.0
    
The GStreamer project is proud to announce a new release of the
GStreamer OpenMAX IL wrapper plugin for the API and ABI-stable
1.x series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.



This module contains a plugin that wraps available OpenMAX IL
components and makes them available as standard GStreamer
elements.



Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
